All the source codes are located in folder middleware

To build the codes, go into folder apps and simply type:
	make
Everything should be built. The generated binary file is called sined. Use the following command to see the parameters.
	./sined -h

Usually we run the demo by the following steps:
1. copy the sine_policy.conf in the sine folder to /etc/sine_policy.conf
2. copy the srelay.conf in the sine folder to /etc/srelay.conf
3. go into folder apps and type
	./sined -c /etc/srelay.conf -f
